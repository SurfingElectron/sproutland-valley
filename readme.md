# Sproutland Valley
I'm currently learning Python through [Exercism](https://exercism.org/), but I've wanted to try out a few of the concepts in real project. Since I love computer games, and I LOVE Stardew Valley, using [Clear Code's](https://www.youtube.com/@ClearCode) tutorial, *Creating a Stardew Valley Inspired Game in Python*, seemed like a great chance to try a few things out.


## Controls
**Movement keys:**
- Up: w *or* ðŸ •
- Down: s *or* ðŸ —
- Left: a *or* ðŸ ” 
- Right: d *or* ðŸ –

**Tools:**
- Use tool: SPACE
- Switch tool: TAB

**Planting:**
- Plant seed: f
- Switch seeds: p


## What did I learn?

#### **Delta time (dt)**
Delta time is the difference between the current and previous frame. You can multiply any movement in the game by this number to make it run smoothly at any frame rate. Movement * Frame Rate * Delta Time = Apparent Movement

|**Frames/Second**|**Pixels/Frame** |**Delta**        |**Pixels/Second**|
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 10              | 10              | 1/10 = 0.1      | 10              |     
| 30              | 10              | 1/30 = 0.33     | 10              |
| 60              | 10              | 1/60 = 0.17     | 10              |
| 120             | 10              | 1/120 = 0.08    | 10              |
| 600             | 10              | 1/600 = 0.002   | 10              |

If used, anything which moves in the game will need delta time applied: animations, rotations, movements, etc. It also means larger numbers are involved (10 pixels / second is really slow, for example). But be careful, delta movements are floating point numbers and Pygame needs *integers* for placing rects because it's pixel information (no such thing as half a pixel). If you only store the position inside the rect, high frame rates can mean no movement as the rect truncates the floating point delta (to 0), so storing the position inside a unique variable is necessary.

#### **Normalising a Vector**
When considering player movement, if they press 2 keys at the same time (i.e. up and right), they will move faster than in just one direction (Pythagoras a^2 + b^2 = c^2). Pygame has an inbuilt method for doing this!

## Challenges
- **os.walk():** First time trying to use this! In helper.py, I tried to use this to import images. I got really stuck for a while as it simply wasn't executing; I checked everything else worked, but the loop using *walk* simply wasn't executing. After lots of googling, it turned out to be a really simple issue; I was executing the code from the wrong directory, and so the relative paths weren't working. A quick cd into code and everything ran perfectly. On the upside, in searching for a solution, I also learnt about listdir(), which is a neater way of getting the same information and cut down the need for an extra *for* loop.

## Improvements
- **Tiling System:** The soil tiling system (in soil.py | create_soil_tiles) currently doesn't check on the diagnonal, so there's a few graphical glitches when creating large areas of tilled soil. 

## Other Thoughts
- **Make a plan:** With such a big project, it really showed the value of going step-by-step, thinking about what you would need in the future and building each component at a time (and testing to make sure that small part worked!).
